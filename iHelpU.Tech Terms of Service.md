### Warranty & Refund Policy

Many repairs offered by Meinhart Solutions LLC come with a limited warranty. Not all devices and repairs come with a warranty. All devices with prior liquid damage or have undergone a prior repair attempt are not eligible for our warranty.

Only repairs that use parts provided by Meinhart Solutions LLC are eligible for our warranty. All repairs that use any customer-provided parts are not eligible for any warranty or refund. 

Warranties will be considered null and void if the device has experienced accidental damage. (Our warranty is not an insurance program, nor a substitute for insurance.) Accidental damage is included but not limited to: 

* Liquid damage
* Fall damage
* Cracked screens
* Cracked front or back glass
* Prior repair attempt (This includes any repairs that are attempted by the customer, other individuals, or other businesses.)

Refunds will not be issued for devices that are in a working or improved condition. Refunds will not be issued unless at least one warranty repair has been attempted. Devices will not be eligible for refund if that device has experienced additional accidental damage since the device has been repaired. Data recovery and training are not eligible for refunds. Up to ten percent of the purchase may be withheld if the initial purchase was made with a credit card, debit card, or other electronic transaction. Refunds will not be processed on repairs paid for by check until seven business days after the check was deposited.

Devices with multiple, unrelated problems to the initial repair may be not be eligible for a full refund and may be subject to a partial refund, no refund, and/or additional terms at the discretion of Meinhart Solutions LLC.

### No Fix, No Fee Policy

Devices that are deemed unfixable by a technician may be returned to the customer at no cost. Customers may cancel the repair at any point and ask for their device back at no cost. However, customers may be subject to a fee if the customer in question wants their device reassembled with the originally installed parts. Any parts that are under the ownership of Meinhart Solutions LLC (in which payment has not been received) and have been installed in or on a customer’s device will be reclaimed before returning the device. Any devices or customer owned parts returned to the customer under this policy are not guaranteed to be in working order and may be in significantly worse condition than when the device or part was presented to Meinhart Solutions LLC for repair. Customers will not be compensated for any damages under the policy.

Business entities may be subject to a bench fee for estimates at the technician's discretion. This is mainly to prevent abuse of our policy.

The no fix, no fee policy no longer applies once payment has been received for a repair. (Please see Warranty & Refund Policy.) 

### Customer Property

Labels may be attached/adhered to customer property as a part of our system to track repairs and prevent device loss. Device-specific charging cables may be needed to complete some repairs.

Cases, tempered glass, SIM cards, micro SD cards, pop sockets, and other accessories are expected to be removed from the device prior to repair. Technicians will make an effort to keep track of any accessories left with the device, however this is not guaranteed. LOST CASES AND ACCESSORIES ARE NOT THE RESPONSIBILITY OF MEINHART SOLUTIONS LLC. Cases and other accessories that are lost or forgotten on our premise become property of Meinhart Solutions LLC and will be given away or sold at our discretion.

Customer intellectual property pertaining to device backups may be stored on our computer systems. Backups will only be made at the customer’s request or at the technician’s discretion. We are not responsible for any data loss. Device and account passwords may be necessary in order to complete certain repairs. Non-disclosure agreements must be made in advance. We do not guarantee backups will be kept after a repair is completed. Customer data may be subject to deletion upon request, after two-weeks of a repair, or if disk space being occupied by customer data is needed for other purposes.

### Missed Payments, Overdue Invoices, And Abandoned Device Policy

Devices will not be returned to the customer until full payment has been received.

Meinhart Solutions LLC will assume sole ownership of all abandoned devices. An abandoned device is defined as a device that is pending on the customer’s input or payment for over 30 days. Meinhart Solutions LLC is not responsible for any lost data or materials when a device is abandoned. Please note that the 30 day timer does not count the time the device is pending repair. 

Abandoned devices will be sold as means of compensation to cover our loss of time and materials spent working on the repair of said device. The abandoned device may be reclaimed by the original owner for the amount due on the repair plus five percent.

Meinhart Solutions LLC will attempt, but is not obligated, to contact the customer once a repair is completed and before a device becomes abandoned. A valid phone and email must be on file. Meinhart Solutions LLC is not responsible for incorrect or outdated contact information. It is the customer’s responsibility to respond to our messages, keep up-to-date contact information, and inform Meinhart Solutions LLC of any contact information changes.

## Repair Specific Terms

Meinhart Solutions LLC may enact special terms and conditions for specific repairs.

### Apple IRP Repairs
#### The following terms apply for all Mac and iPhone repairs covered under the Apple Independent Repair Provider (IRP) program:  
Additional user information may be required prior to creating an IRP repair. Apple requires this information to 
Find My must be disabled on the unit under repair for the duration of the repair. This includes when the repair is still active.

### Motorola Phone Repairs

There will be no warranty available on some Motorola or Lenovo phone repairs. This is due to the poor build quality of select Motorola devices. Warranties from the manufacturer of the part may still be valid. The customer is responsible for any fees associated with claiming the warranty on manufacturer parts. Labor will still be charged at the standard rate for all warranty and repeat repairs.

### Samsung Galaxy Repairs

Several modern Samsung smartphones, including the Galaxy S series and Galaxy Note series, must be serviced by taking the back cover of the phone off first. Many of these same phones use glass for the back cover of their design. While we have the experience and expertise to remove the back glass without defect most of the time, the glass is still very fragile and is highly prone to cracking. Meinhart Solutions LLC will replace the back glass with a generic panel at no additional charge in the event the original glass is damaged during the repair. The customer may, however, choose to upgrade to an OEM back glass panel. OEM panels will be charged in addition to the repair and are not included in the original price.

### iPad Repairs

iPads that use Touch ID or Face ID require special hardware that is unique to each device in order for these services to work. There is a small chance that this hardware may be damaged on the device during hardware repairs.  

The customer will be presented with three options in the event irreplaceable hardware is damaged in the repair process. 

1. The customer can choose to continue the repair at a significantly discounted price with the expectation that Touch ID / Face ID will not work when the repair is complete. 
2. The customer can opt to go with a whole-unit replacement with the same model year or newer priced at fair market value. A generous offer to purchase the broken device will be made as means of compensation for the inconvenience. 
3. The customer may enforce our “No Fix, No Fee” policy and have the repair returned to them as is at no cost. Repairs under this clause are still subject to our “Warranty & Refund Policy”. 

Devices with prior repair attempts will not be eligible for discounts or whole-unit replacements.
